# JSONEssentialTraining
Taking a JSON training course and using git to track progress. 
This upload and (all the edits it contains from the original distribution) is solely for educational purposes. The purpose of this repo is for better familiarizing myself with both git, and JSON as a technology to be used for web development. I have no intention as claiming these files, which were originally exercise files accomodating a course from LinkedInLearning, as my own creations.
